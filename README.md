## Configuration

Simply change the `config.js` file. The comments make it pretty self-explanatory.

## Running

To run this faucet you have to have a WalletAPI and a daemon running.

> âš  This project only works until Turtlecoin version v0.18.0. Anything after the big RPC rewrite **does not work**.
